## Problem Statement

Identify condition of the sales activities and gain insights/trends happening over sales volumes
over the 2016 to 2018 period. 
Identify revenues per region/store/product category/brand, and list of top customers/sales reps.

### Steps to complete
1. Collect and gather the data
2. Clean the data
3. Visualize and analyze the data(I used Excel and Tableau to create 2 dashboards for this portfolio)
4. Interpret the results

### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load SQL server sample database, Identify what features are necessary from the dataset and write a SQL code to collect the data. (Order ID, Customers first and last name, city, state, order date, sales volume, revenue, product name, product cat, brand name, store name, sales rep)

- Step 2 : Write SQL query to preprocess the data, create new columns such as revenue and total units.

- Step 3 : Connect queried dataset to Excel.

- Step 5 : Create pivot tables to prepare data for visualization.

- Step 6 : Pick and test visualizations for our dashboard to consider what can provide the most value to our users.

(In this regard, we have chosen charts to display revenue by year, revenue over months, revenue by state, revenue by store, revenue by category, top 10 customers, and top sales reps)

### Tableau Dashboard Creation

- Step 7 : Loaded the Excel dataset connected from the SQL queried database.

- Step 8 : Created similiar charts to the Excel with more visual formatting.
